## native-wrappers-client Typescript Example

This example compiles a Typescript webpack project that you can use in your FiveM server. It allows a player to spawn an Adder vehicle at their current location and sets the player into the vehicle.  
Thanks to the [`yarn` and `webpack` resources](https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data/tree/master/resources/%5Bsystem%5D/%5Bbuilders%5D), dependencies will be installed and the project will be automagically compiled on resource start.

For building without the FiveM builders, checkout [fivem-ts-boilerplate](https://github.com/d0p3t/fivem-ts-boilerplate)
